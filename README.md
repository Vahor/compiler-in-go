# Writing an interpreter in **GO**


## Notes:
- [Book](https://compilerbook.com/)
- [Interpreter in _~~Go~~_ **Rust**](https://github.com/Vahor/interpreter-in-rust)

This time I'll do it in **Go** and follow the book. As I used rust for the previous step, I've used the go `00` version of the interpreter as a starting point.
